Entries for the Machine Learning Madness competition hosted on Kaggle to accurately predict the NCAA Tourament using machine learning techniques. I am utilizing a logistic regression algorithm that was backtested on the 2016 NCAA Tourament using training data from the 2003-2015 seasons and rankings as given by people such as Ken Pomeroy, Kenneth Massey, and Jeff Sagarin, among others. The algorithm achieved a 78% accuracy rating, a 5% improvement over the 73% average that picking straight seeds would achieve.
