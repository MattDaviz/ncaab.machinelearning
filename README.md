Entries for the Machine Learning Madness competition hosted on Kaggle to accurately predict the NCAA Tourament using machine learning techniques. In 2019, I utilized a logistic regression algorithm that was backtested on the 2018 NCAA Tourament using training data from the 2003-2017 seasons and rankings as given by people such as Ken Pomeroy, Kenneth Massey, and Jeff Sagarin, among others. My entry placed in the Top 25% of the competition.
